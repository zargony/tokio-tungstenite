//! A simple example of hooking up stdin/stdout to a WebSocket stream.
//!
//! This example will connect to a server specified in the argument list and
//! then forward all data read on stdin to the server, printing out all data
//! received on stdout.
//!
//! Note that this is not currently optimized for performance, especially around
//! buffer management. Rather it's intended to show an example of working with a
//! client.
//!
//! You can use this example together with the `server` example.
